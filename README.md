## Personal_porfolio

This repo is my online portfolio code, 
it's developed HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript. 

No React.js as it's developed before EDA.
I updated few more page after EDA and noticed how React is much
easier to control! 

And oh my god! My CSS file ...too much and without me no one gonna understand!
How bad practice for team project, if it was!
